                <p><strong>Dedication</strong></p>
                <p>This website is dedicated to a family member affected by a sensitivity to fragrances and the
                    tens of thousands of people who share similar struggles.</p>

                <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p>This full stack web applciation was developed over 11 weeks as part of a Personal Projects
                    elective class as part of my Computer Science bachelors degree at Oregon State University. In
                    addition to my classwork, I dedicated myself to learning additional languages and frameworks with
                    the goal of independently developing a web application. This website is a realization of those
                    efforts.</p>

                <p><strong>Web Application Features</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Security - Implemented Spring Security using JWT with backend access privileges for each
                        endpoint and frontend dynamic page rendering based on roles and record creator. Uses roles for
                        Visitor, User, Moderator, and Administrator.
                    </li>
                    <li>User Interface - Developed a dynamic SPA using React, Typescript, and React-Bootstrap.</li>
                    <li>Cloud Development - Created using an MVC model,</li>
                    <li>Database Design -</li>
                    <li>Compatibility</li>
                    <li>Error Handling</li>
                    <li>Performance - cached variables, simple entites that do not require mapping/dto, db connection
                        pools
                    </li>
                    <li>Entities - Performing CRUD operations on a range of entities: Businesses, Products, Rental
                        Homes, Entity Reviews, Support Tickets, and Users.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
                <p>Broken down into the following areas: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Project Scale - This was a sizable project that required learning many new skills.</li>
                    <li>Backend Design - There were a number of backend design iterations attempting to find the balance
                        between code simplicity and functionality.
                    </li>
                    <li>Deployment Options - Chosing which services to use and how to configure them.</li>
                    <li>Frontend Design - How to layer Props and Components</li>
                    <li>Scope Creep - The balance between the features that are needed and the ones that would be nice
                        to have.
                    </li>
                    <li>Best Practices Balance - In smaller projects, it has been possible to do it all: detailed
                        documentation, lenting, layered testing approaches, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p><strong>Details:</strong> The program does uses the following custom classes:</p>
            <ol>
                    <li>Service - the base class for all services providing common functionality for sub-class services.</li>
                    <li>Specific Service implementations - DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, ICMP Echo, ICMP Ping, NTP, TCP, UDP</li>
                    <li>Result - the base class for all service results providing common functionality.  Specific implementations are written in each specific service implementation (#2 above).  Sent between the server and the client as a payload in a Packet object (#4 below).</li>
                    <li>Packet - a data transfer object between the Server and Client with sender, receiver, payload, timestamp, and status.</li>
                    <li>Config - a data transfer object that transfers the services and Unique Identifiers between the server and client. Sent in the payload of a Packet object.</li>
                    <li>StatusEnum - a Enum that controls the current status states of the server, client, each service, and every Packet. It is also used to control the information flow between the server and client by sending change of state requests such as config, resume, pause, and shutdown.  Is carried in each Result object and each Packet object.</li>
                    <li>Setup - a class that stores the Network Monitor configuration and allows it to be serialized for saving/loading configuration data.</li>
                    <li>RunServices - uses multi-threading to asynchronously run each service and deliver the test Result objects to a common deque for transmission to the client from the server.</li>
                    <li>ManagementService - performs the Management Service Requirements as outlined in the assignment using the above classes.</li>
                    <li>MonitoringService - performs the Monitoring Service Requirements as outlined in the assignment using the above classes.</li>
                    <li>App - provides the UI for configuring the program and running it.</li>
            </ol>

                <li><em>Backend: </em> Uses an AWS Lambda Function running Python.  Uses an AWS API Gateway with Proxy Integration to inject the request into the Lambda function and return the response.  Code was written in PyCharm, tested, deployed to AWS and tested using Postman. </li>

                    <li>Adds the Activity objects to a list for iteration.</li>
                    <li>Iterates through each Activity using a method to compare the forecast to the Activity ideal conditions, generating a nested dictionary of activities and ideal time windows.</li>

            <p><strong>App Type:</strong> Multi-threaded desktop Java Application</p>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Creation of a Blockchain message/transaction service including Block generation, messaging/transactions, mining, and validation.</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> The program does the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Initializes a Message Service that:</li>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Creates a group of users - each with their own private/public keys, SHA256 signature, and starting Virtual Currency balance.</li>
                    <li>Creates a random number of transactions and validates each one for funds and authenticity.</li>
                 </ol>
                 <li>Initializes a Zero Service that will increase/decrease the number of leading zeros required to dynamically control the Block mining times.</li>
                 <li>Performs the mining operations for each Block until the requested number of blocks have been generated:</li>
                 <ol>
                    <li>Saves simple (for display) and complex (for authentication) version of the transaction string for synchronized use of the threads. </li>
                    <li>Creates an ExecutorService and loads a thread for each processor core - 1 with a mining task.</li>
                    <li>Each thread will perform the following tasks:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Save a copy of the shared variables to reduce variable acquisition/synchronization times for each thread.</li>
                        <li>Generate a random Unique Block Identification code. </li>
                        <li>For each iteration, perform the following: </li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Generate a random Magic Number</li>
                            <li>Generate a hash accounting for all unique elements of the Block - the miner, Unique Block Identifier, Magic Number, hash code from the previous Block, authentication string of the transaction data.</li>
                            <li>Check if the randomly generated hash code from above meets the Zero Requirement (the number of leading zeros required).</li>
                            <li>If successful, return the valid block, else perform the next iteration.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Executes the threads with the invokeAny method to shutdown all mining threads once a single one has found a solution.</li>
                    <li>Once a return is successful, it will validate the mined Block, add it to the chain, provide mining time feedback to the zero service. </li>
                 </ol>
                 
            </ol>
